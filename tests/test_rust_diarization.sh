echo "✅ Plugin compiled successfully with improved settings:"
echo "  - Lower similarity threshold: 0.55 (was 0.75)"
echo "  - Better VAD threshold: 0.01 (was 0.02)"
echo "  - Shorter silence duration: 1.5s (was 2.0s)"
echo "  - Enhanced spectral features with normalization"
echo "  - More discriminative voice characteristics"
echo "  - Conservative clustering with temporal context"
echo "  - Improved fundamental frequency estimation"

echo "🎯 Key improvements for better speaker detection:"
echo "  1. More sensitive similarity threshold"
echo "  2. Enhanced spectral feature extraction"
echo "  3. Better voice activity detection"
echo "  4. Improved fundamental frequency estimation"
echo "  5. Conservative clustering algorithm"
