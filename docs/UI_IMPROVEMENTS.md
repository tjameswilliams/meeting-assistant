# UI Improvements: Enhanced Code Highlighting & Thinking Model Support

## ✅ **Improvements Applied**

### 1. 🎨 **Enhanced Syntax Highlighting Color Scheme**

**Problem:** Code blocks were displaying in dark grey, making them hard to read and distinguish.

**Solution:** Upgraded from `base16-ocean.dark` to **Monokai** theme with intelligent fallbacks:

```rust
// New theme selection with fallbacks
let theme = &self.theme_set.themes.get("Monokai")
    .or_else(|| self.theme_set.themes.get("InspiredGitHub"))
    .or_else(|| self.theme_set.themes.get("Solarized (dark)"))
    .unwrap_or_else(|| &self.theme_set.themes["base16-ocean.dark"]);
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Vibrant colors** for better readability
- ✅ **High contrast** for terminal visibility
- ✅ **Fallback themes** for compatibility
- ✅ **Extended language support** (added JSON, XML, YAML, SQL, Go, Java, C, PHP, Ruby)

### 2. 🧠 **Thinking Model Support**

**Problem:** When using thinking models (like OpenAI o1), the response included internal reasoning text that cluttered the output.

**Solution:** Intelligent thinking text removal with comprehensive pattern matching:

````rust
fn remove_thinking_text(&self, text: &str) -> String {
    // Removes various thinking patterns:
    // - <thinking>...</thinking>
    // - <reasoning>...</reasoning>
    // - ```thinking\n...\n```
    // - Markdown headers like "# Thinking"
    // + Cleanup of extra whitespace
}
````

**Patterns Detected & Removed:**

- ✅ `<thinking>...internal thoughts...</thinking>`
- ✅ `<reasoning>...analysis...</reasoning>`
- ✅ `<internal>...monologue...</internal>`
- ✅ Markdown thinking blocks: ` ```thinking\n...\n``` `
- ✅ Thinking headers: `# Thinking` or `## Reasoning`
- ✅ Cleanup of extra newlines and whitespace

### 3. 📍 **Applied Throughout the System**

The improvements are applied in:

- ✅ **Main AI responses** (`stream_response`)
- ✅ **Session history display** (thinking text removed from previews)
- ✅ **Code clipboard analysis** (better syntax highlighting)
- ✅ **All code blocks** in markdown responses

## 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

### Before:

```
# Dark grey code that's hard to read
const axios = require('axios'); // barely visible
```

### After:

```javascript
// Vibrant, colorful syntax highlighting
const axios = require("axios"); // keywords in blue, strings in green, etc.
const fs = require("fs");
```

### Before (with thinking model):

```
<thinking>
Let me analyze this code step by step...
The user is asking about streaming data...
I should explain the axios.get() method...
</thinking>

Here's how to stream data from an API:

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### Syntax Highlighting Engine

- **Engine:** Syntect (best-in-class Rust syntax highlighting)
- **Theme:** Monokai (optimized for dark terminals)
- **Languages:** 15+ programming languages supported
- **Fallbacks:** Multiple theme options for compatibility

### Thinking Text Removal

- **Method:** Regex-based pattern matching
- **Performance:** Minimal overhead, processed once per response
- **Robustness:** Handles multiple thinking text formats
- **Safety:** Preserves all non-thinking content

## 🚀 **Ready to Use**

The improvements are immediately active in your application:

1. **Copy any code** to clipboard and use `Double-tap 'S'` to see vibrant syntax highlighting
2. **Use thinking models** (like o1) and see clean responses without internal reasoning
3. **View session history** with `Double-tap 'H'` to see improved previews

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

Potential future improvements:

- **Custom themes** based on user preferences
- **Dynamic theme switching** (light/dark mode)
- **Model-specific thinking patterns** for different AI providers
- **Syntax highlighting** for more specialized languages

The codebase is now ready to provide a much better visual experience for code analysis and AI interactions! 🎉
